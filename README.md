# WordMath

Word math is a package for converting numbers to and from their English word representations or using them in that format. The `Number` object can be created with a number or string of words. When created with a value, the correct words are generated. When created with words, the words are parsed according to English language rules for numbers.

## Roadmap

Upcoming features (in no particular order):

1. Support for non-integer numbers
1. Support for languages other than English
1. Support for more number formats (e.g., allowing commas or hyphens)
1. Functionality for parsing whole expressions/equations
    1. Basic operations (add/subtract/multiply/divide)
    1. Complex operations (exponents/logarithms/etc)
1. Support for mixed numbers and words (e.g., "5 hundred")
1. Better error handling and exception messages
1. Greater flexibility for less formal language (e.g., "twenty two hundred")
1. Greater visibility into the implementation for predicitions/suggestions (e.g., what words are allowed after "thirty seven")
